# ðŸŒ® Little Taco Shop (LTS)

A simple, responsive web page for a fictional taco shop. This project was originally built by following a course by Dave Gray and later enhanced with additional features.

The project is accessible and responsive and uses modern CSS techniques to achieve this.

## âœ¨ Few Features I added

- Theme toggle (light/dark mode)
- Infinite scroll animation
- Responsive card section

Features and styling ideas were inspired by various front-end tutorials and creators like SlayingtheDragon,Coding2Go,Kevin Powell
A lot of effort went into building and customizing this project.
